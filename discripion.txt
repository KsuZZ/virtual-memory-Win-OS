Each page has its own descriptor, which contains all the necessary information about the page. 
In addition to the information about the state of the page in the descriptor, the virtual memory 
management system stores the state of the pages in the page database. In this database, a page 
can be marked as having one of the following states:
-> Free. The page is available for use after filling it with zeros.
-> Zeros. The page is free, filled with zeros and is available for use by applications.
-> Correct. The page is used by the active process.
-> Modified. The content of the page has been changed, but the page has not yet been saved to disk in the page file (not rolled).
-> Spare. The page has been removed from the current set of virtual process pages.
-> Bad. Access to this page leads to a hardware error.

Warning!!!
Some versions of the Visual Studio may produce an error, you need to turn off error checking for this. 
This is not possible professionally, but other ways to eliminate errors do not always work.
*I worked in the Visual Studio 2015-2017, this is the Microsoft development environment (for those who work in a different environment)
